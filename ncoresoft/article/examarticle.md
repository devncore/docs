## Use markdown grammar to create a good looking document
> Markdown is a text-based markup language created by John Groover in 2004 and is easy to write and read and convert to HTML. Using a very simple structure of grammar using special symbols and characters, content can be written more quickly and recognized more intuitively on the web. The reason why Markdown has recently begun to gain popularity is because of GitHub (https://github.com). README.md, which records information about GitHub's repository repository, was the first markdown document anyone using GitHub would encounter. As the strength of the simple recording of installation methods, source code descriptions, and issues through markdown is highlighted, it will gradually spread to various places.
